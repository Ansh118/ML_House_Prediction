## Houses Prices Prediction Project
This is the Machine Learning Project, there are two models that are trained on the given **Dataset**. The dataset is huge large and in .csv format. The datasets have couples of attributes. 
Firstly the dataset is pre-processed, remove duplicate values, and cleaned. 
Both Classification and Regression gives better Accuracy on training and testing. 

### Future Enhancements
It can be integrate in Mobile or Web Applications where it can take input data according to dataset requirement and then train that and show the results. I am working on this Feature and soon integrate it in form of Application. So users can use this real- world.
